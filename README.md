# Shopping Cart Assignment

You must create two classes: Product and Order.

* A product will hold a product that can be purchased in this webshop.
* An order will hold one or more products ordered in this webshop.

public/index.php is the webroot. In this file, do the following:
* Create some products:
    * id: 123_pants; name: Jeans; price: 75.50
    * id: 245_tshirt_blue; name: T-shirt blue; price: 12.50
    * id: 245_tshirt_red; name: T-shirt red; price: 12.50

* Add products to order:
    * 245_tshirt_blue * 2
    * 245_tshirt_red * 1
    * 123_pants * 2

* Delete a product from the order by id, 
* Get the subtotal for a product in the order. 
* Get the total for the entire order. 

Good luck!
